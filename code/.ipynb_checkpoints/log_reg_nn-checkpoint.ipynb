    "The results indicate that the model training process stopped early at epoch 95 due to early stopping criteria being met, with model weights restored from the end of the best epoch, which was epoch 55. This approach suggests that the model performance was optimal around epoch 55 based on the validation criteria used (likely validation loss or another metric). The prediction phase followed, showing predictions (`y_pred`) for 150 samples with a shape of (150, 1), and the actual labels (`labels_test`) also for 150 samples with a shape of (150,). The coefficient of determination (R-squared value) for the predictions compared to the actual labels is 0.819, indicating that the model explains approximately 81.9% of the variance in the test data, which suggests a reasonably good fit of the model to the test set."
