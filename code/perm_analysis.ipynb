    "It is a model inspection technique that measures the contribution of each feature to a fitted model's statistical performance on a given tabular dataset.\n",
    "This technique is particularly useful for non-linear or opaque estimators (i.e., an object that manages estimation and decoding of a model) and involves random shuffling the values of a single feature and observing the resulting degradation of the model's score. The intuition behind this analysis is that by breaking the relationship between the predictor and the target variable, we can determine how much the model relies on such particular feature.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "The results from the permutation analysis provide insights into the relative importance of different features in predicting the outcome, likely related to admission success in this context. Based on the analysis, it appears that CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) is the most influential predictor, with a mean importance score of 0.806 and a standard deviation of 0.111. This indicates that variations in CGPA have a substantial impact on the predicted outcome. Following CGPA, the GRE Score also shows significant importance, although to a much lesser extent with a mean score of 0.033 and a standard deviation of 0.022. SOP (Statement of Purpose), Research experience, and LOR (Letter of Recommendation) also contribute positively to the prediction, albeit with smaller mean importance scores ranging from 0.021 to 0.009 and associated standard deviations. University Rating and TOEFL Score, on the other hand, appear to have relatively minor impacts, each with mean scores of 0.008 and 0.005, respectively, and similarly low standard deviations. These findings suggest that while all features contribute to the predictive model, CGPA and GRE Score carry the most weight in determining the predicted outcome in this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the permutation analysis above show that `CGPA` is a very important feature since the model relies heavily on it to make predictions. As mentioned earlier, the fact that the model relies heavily on that it means that during the permutation analysis when the relationship between the prediction and the output got broken, the model underperformed.\n",
    "Therefore for the neural network we will take into account only the first 4 features. We could even reduce to `CGPA` since it is the most important features, but just for the sake of plurality we use `CGPA`, `GRE Score`, `SOP`, `Research`."
